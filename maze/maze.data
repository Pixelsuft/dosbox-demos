#       fullscreen: Start dosbox directly in fullscreen. (Press ALT-Enter to go back)
#       fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox.
#   fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original, desktop or fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                     Using your monitor's native resolution (desktop) with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                     If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
#                     On Windows 10 with display scaling (Scale and layout) set to a value above 100%, it is recommended
#                     to use a lower full/windowresolution, in order to avoid window size problems.
# windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                     (output=surface does not!)
#           output: What video system to use for output.
#                   Possible values: surface, overlay, opengl, openglnb, ddraw.
#         autolock: Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
#      sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity.
#      waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if dosbox has an error.

#                     pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                   Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#       mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the defaul value.

[render]
# frameskip: How many frames DOSBox skips before drawing one.
#    aspect: Do aspect correction, if your output method doesn't support scaling this can slow things down!
#    scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes. If 'forced' is appended,
#              then the scaler will be used even if the result might not be desired.
#              To fit a scaler in the resolution used at full screen may require a border or side bars,

#            Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
#              'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
#                              It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
#              'fixed #number' will set a fixed amount of cycles. This is what you usually
#                              need if 'auto' fails. (Example: fixed 4000).
#              'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
#                              handle.
#            Possible values: auto, fixed, max.

Game Descriptions:

This is a 2 player game. It can be played in a solo mode with a synthetic 
opponent generated by the computer, but for best results two computer are 
needed. The object of the game is to hunt down and destroy your opponent. 
This is not an easy task. At the start of each game, both you and your 
opponent are placed in a randomly selected labyrinth at random positions. 
You don't know where your opponent is hiding. All you have to work with is 
a 3-Dimensional view of the corridor you are standing in, a top down view of 
the labyrinth, and a changing sonar blip that can guide you to your opponent 
if you interpret it properly.

To win the game, you must hunt down your opponent and shoot him with your 
laser beams until he runs out of energy and dies. There is only one problem. 
This is a real-time game. While you are shooting at your opponent, he gets 
to shoot back at you. Whoever is fastest with the laser beams and has the 
strongest nerve wins. If you lose your nerve, you can turn and run away. 
This is not always a bad idea. One of the best strategies of this game is to 
sneak up on your opponent and shoot him in the back!

While were on the subject of being sneaky, at any time either player can 
press a key and make the top-down view of the labyrinth vanish on both 
computer. Of course, your opponent can press the same key and the top-down 
view will reappear. It's fun negotiate which top-down view mode to use.

A Fast Start:

This game of Maze provides beautiful 3-Dimensional and top-down views of 
the labyrinth and your human or computer opponent. Sonar blips tell you 
how close you are to your opponent: you must figure out how to negotiate 
the labyrinth to get close enough to your opponent to fire. If you are in 
danger of being destroyed then you can run away and recuperate. Taunt your 
opponent with his cowardice for running away, or entice him into your trap, 
or send any message through the message box.

For a fast start, just you against the computer, type "Maze" at the DOS 
prompt, type the F9 key to enter solo play mode, and use the arrow keys to 
move around. Here is a quick overview of all of the function keys:

The Function Keys:

     F1 - Quick help display

     F2 - Make a new maze

     F3 - Open communications

     F4 - Close communications

     F5 - Toggle blind mode in top down view

     F6 - Toggle sonar sound on/off

     F7 - Display opponent's position

     F8 - Auto hunt opponent

     F9 - Solo play

     F10 - Quit

     Up-Arrow - Move forward

     Left-Arrow - Turn to left

     Right-Arrow - Turn to right

     Down-Arrow - Turn around

     Home - Run forward to intersection

     PgUp - Fire 

     Ins - Turn around and run

     Alpha Keys - Talk to your opponent

The Sights:

The North-South walls of the labyrinth are light grey bricks, and the 
East-West walls are light brown. The ground is green and the sky is light 
blue. The bright yellow orb of your opponent's face shows iridescent glowing 
eyes. The harder you have hit him, the lower he is to the ground. And each 
time you are hit, you lose two units of energy from your energy bar which 
is in the bottom of the message box.

You may use the F5 key to turn off the top-down view for both you and your 
opponent: it will be rebuilt as you walk around the labyrinth. This blind 
mode makes tracking your opponent much more difficult, and makes it much 
easier for you to hide while you regenerate your energy.

The Sounds:

The higher the pitch of the sonar blip and the faster the beat, the closer 
you are to your opponent. A low shrill sounds when you fire, and a high 
shrill sounds when you have been hit.

The Function Keys in Detail:

     F1 - Quick help information

Typing F1 will display a brief list of function key names in the message 
window. This list will remain there until F1 is pressed again or some other 
function require use of the message window.

     F2 - Make a new maze 

Each time you or your opponent wins you will be in a completely new, randomly 
generated labyrinth. You may request a new labyrinth at any time by typing 
the F2 key. Your opponent will immediately be transported into your new 
labyrinth.

     F3 - Open communications

Typing F3 will open a communication path between your computer and another 
computer running the Maze game. Use the function keys to select the COM port 
and baud rate for your computer. If you are using a modem, it can perform an 
auto-dial sequence supplied on the modem command string, or you may manually 
dial. You may also be directly connected between two computers using a null 
modem.

If you have a Hayes auto-dial modem, then you can connect to another user for 
2 player mode by entering the modem command string:

     ATDT555-1212  (use this to call out)

or

     ATS0=1  (use this to answer) 

The Open communications option is more fully explained in Appendix A.

     F4 - Close communications

If you have been playing in 2 player mode and wish to hang up the phone to 
close off communications, then type F4.

     F5 - Toggle blind mode in top down view

When you start the game you are shown a full top-down view of the labyrinth 
so you can orient yourself and find the shortest path to where you believe 
your opponent to be. If you type the F5 key, then both you and your opponent 
will lose that top-down view. Instead, you will recreate it based on what you 
can see in the 3-D view. As you move around, your top-down view will show you 
the shape of the labyrinth for everywhere that you have been. Playing in this 
blind mode makes the game much more difficult.

     F6 - Toggle sonar sound on/off

If you want to play without the echo-locator sonar, or to just play more 
quietly, use the F6 key to turn the sonar sound off. To restore the sonar 
sound use the F6 key again.

     F7 - Display opponent's position

When you are playing in solo mode, you can cause the computer to aid you by 
displaying your opponents position on the top-down view. This will allow you 
to more easily chase or run from your opponent.

     F8 - Auto hunt opponent

When you are playing in solo mode, use the automatic hunt function to run as 
fast and directly as possible directly toward your opponent, until you are 
within 3 steps.

     F9 - Solo play

If you want to sharpen your hunting and tracking skills by playing against 
the computer type F9 to enter solo play mode. The computer will act as your 
opponent, tracking you down through the labyrinth and shooting you and being 
shot by you. He understands the value of running to work off his hits, so you 
may have a job tracking him down and hitting him enough times to do him in.

     F10 - Quit

Typing F10 causes communications to be closed and the program exits to DOS.

     Up-Arrow - Move forward

The up-arrow key causes you to move forward one step in the labyrinth, or to 
turn if you are in a corner facing a wall.

     Left-Arrow - Turn to left

The left-arrow key causes you to move toward the left of your 3-D view. Note 
that this is not necessarily the same as moving left on the top-down view.

     Right-Arrow - Turn to right

The right-arrow key causes you to move toward the right of your 3-D view.

     Down-Arrow - Turn around

To reverse direction, or to face your opponent who has snuck up behind you, 
use the down-arrow key.

     Home - Run forward to intersection

The Home key moves you forward through the labyrinth until you hit an 
intersection and must make a choice of direction, or until you encounter 
your opponent.

     PgUp - Fire

The PgUp key will fire a round at your opponent. Each round uses one unit of 
energy from your energy bar which is in the bottom of the message box. When 
you are hit, you lose two units of energy. If you run out of energy, your gun 
stops working and you can be killed. The harder you hit your opponent, the 
lower he will sink toward the ground. You can fire at his back and he can 
fire at yours, if that is the kind of players you are.

     Ins - Turn around and run

If your opponent is getting the better of you, you can make quick exit by 
typing the Ins key. It will turn you around and start you running. Note that 
this may not do you any good if you are in a dead end alley.

     Alpha Keys - Talk to your opponent

Anything you type on the keyboard will appear on the top line of your message 
box and the bottom line of your opponent's message box. Use it to chat, taunt 
your opponent, arrange a tryst, exchange admiration, negotiate how you will 
play, or any other way you can imagine. The line will clear when you type a 
carriage return or reach the end of the line.



		Appendix A - Open Communications Menu - (F3)

The Maze game gets the information it needs to communicate with another 
player from the Open communication menu (F3). Once in the menu, use the 
function keys (F1 - F9) to select COM port, baud rate, and modem command 
string.

Use F1 - F4 to select the COM port the Maze game should communicate through:

     F1 - COM1  (use COM port 1)

     F2 - COM2  (use COM port 2)

     F3 - COM3  (use COM port 3)

     F4 - COM4  (use COM port 4)

Use F5 - F8 to select the baud rate (speed) the computer should send data 
through the COM port:

     F5 - 300    (300 baud)

     F6 - 1200  (1200 baud)

     F7 - 2400  (2400 baud)

     F8 - 9600  (9600 baud)

Use F9 to enter a modem command string. The command string is a series of 
characters passed to the modem that instruct it to dial a number or answer 
the phone line. For a Hayes modem originating a call, this might be 
ATDT555-1212 to dial using touch tones to the phone number 555-1212. For a 
Hayes modem answering a call, this might be ATS0=1, which would set 
auto-answer mode on in the modem.

For a manually dialed call, or for direct connection through a null-modem 
cable, the modem command does not need to be given (but the port and baud 
rate must be given).

For another type of modem, or to use different dialing or answering 
parameters, refer to your modem handbook.


		    Appendix B - RS232 Hardware Signals

The number of hardware signals required to run MAZE depends on the type 
of connection used between computers. A direct connect uses three pins, 
(2) TRANSMIT, (3) RECEIVE, and (7) SIGNAL GROUND. Pins (2) and (3) must 
me swapped once between the two machines.

An auto-dial modem uses five pins, (2) TRANSMIT, (3) RECEIVE, (7) SIGNAL 
GROUND, (8) DATA CARRIER DETECT, and (20) DATA TERMINAL READY. There is not 
a swap between pins (2) and (3) with a modem.

There is one (1) additional pin signal provided by MAZE that some serial 
cards and/or modems require. The signal is pin (4) REQUEST TO SEND. Most 
machines will function properly without this extra signal; it is included 
for completeness. 


SPECIAL NOTE:

MAZE uses pin (20) DATA TERMINAL READY to signal the modem when to hang-up 
the phone line and reset to command state. This DTR monitoring option is 
switch selectable on some modems. You should check your modem for this 
option before making long distance phone calls through MAZE. If this option 
is improperly set, the phone will not hang-up when MAZE exits and you will 
accumulate excess long distance charges.

The proper modem DTR setting is:

     DTR high - process dial command and connect normally

     DTR low - Hang-up phone line and reset to command state.




		    Appendix C - Video Adapter and Monitor

You must have an Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) installed in your computer 
as the primary graphics device along with a matching color monitor. Maze does 
not support CGA graphic at this time. If Maze is run on a computer that does 
not have an EGA installed, it will detect the absents of the EGA and refuse 
to run.
